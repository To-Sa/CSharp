### "ACCESS MODIFIERS"
* All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies. 
    * **Private:** The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
    * **Public:** The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
    * **Protected:** The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.
### "CLASS"
### "ENCAPSULATION"
Encapsulation is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package'. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.
### "INHERITANCE"
Inheritance, together with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming. Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior that is defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. 
### "METHOD"
### "UML"
* The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
